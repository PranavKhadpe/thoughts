<p>Build a big business on top of and around a successful platform by adding something of your own that is both substantial and differentiated. Take, for example, our national road and highway system. If you view it as the transportation platform, you start to see the host of highly differentiated businesses that have been built on top of it, ranging from FedEx to Tesla. The ridesharing service Lyft is building its business on top of that same transportation platform, as well as Amazon’s AWS platform.</p>

<p>Cross-sectional: A sponsored open-source community is heterogenous and consists of developers within the sponsoring firm, developers outside the sponsoring firm, and users. Firms need to figure out ways to indirectly influence the community since community members outside the boundaries of the firm are not bound by contractual relationships. As such, firms use their employees as a means of injecting their influence into a project, providing firms with a mechanism of indirect control. <a href="https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1471772715000111?token=D094A183B8CCBFBF8CA85E63665C958758C014ED78A996947FC05BA5139B99E9A6FB6AA44DABC5828E6F927ED8438E45&#x26;originRegion=us-east-1&#x26;originCreation=20220613145756">How do firms influence open source software communities? A framework and empirical analysis of different governance modes</a></p>
<p>Longitudinal: If the community is initiated by members of the firm,at initiation the power is concentrated in the firm--- the only members of the community are its employees. As newcomers join the community, the power-sharing chocies of the firm decide the degree to which power is shared with external members. It is possible that people outside the firm are permanently relegated to the periphery.</p>

<p>One interviewee pointed out that large companies like Google/FB don't actually just use open source packages that easily. Can we quantify exactly how much open source software gets used?</p>

<p>Herbert Simon famously said, “Every problem-solving effort must begin with creating a
representation for the problem” and “solving a problem simply means representing it so as to make
the solution transparent” (Simon, 1996, pp. 108 and 132). In other words, good representations can
help illuminate important dimensions of a problem.</p>
