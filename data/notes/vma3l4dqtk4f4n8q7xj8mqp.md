## 'Teams' can be equated to 'chasis constructors'

Starting with the 1981 season, any team competing in the Formula 1 is required to own intellectual property rights to its chasis but intellectual property rights to its engine can be owned by a different entity. So a company that manufactures an engine---an engine constructor---can provide its engine to and be part of mulitple teams but every team has to have a unique chasis constructor. As a result, teams can be thought of as chasis constructors who ultimately compete with each other, each deciding who the right engine provider for them is. This view that advances the chasis constructor as the principal constituent of a team, directly follows from chasis and engine IP ownership requirements, and is also implicit in the [Formula 1 sporting regulations](https://www.fia.com/file/70710/download/23276?token=szOjLZMY), Section 6.3 of which asserts that when a team wins the Constructor Championship, if the constructor of the chassis is not the same as that of the engine, the title will be awarded to the former (the name of the chasis constructor also precedes the name of the engine constructor in the name of the team).
