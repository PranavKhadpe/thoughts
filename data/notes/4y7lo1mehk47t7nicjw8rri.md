Regina's talk:

- All communities are online communities

- Nooks is basically a tool that let's people branch of into smaller groups away from a larger space

- I am wondering about socializing different circles or niches, across different parts of a large, decentralized community. Esp. when learning looks different in those different circles (yet aligned on a common goal)- Justin Flory

- Ned Batchelder- soem framing scaffolding

- Talking to the collective is not ideal?
