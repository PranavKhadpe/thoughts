> Build a big business on top of and around a successful platform by adding something of your own that is both substantial and differentiated. Take, for example, our national road and highway system. If you view it as the transportation platform, you start to see the host of highly differentiated businesses that have been built on top of it, ranging from FedEx to Tesla. The ridesharing service Lyft is building its business on top of that same transportation platform, as well as Amazonâ€™s AWS platform.

## Cross-sectional Perspective versus Longitudinal Perspective

Cross-sectional: A sponsored open-source community is heterogenous and consists of developers within the sponsoring firm, developers outside the sponsoring firm, and users. Firms need to figure out ways to indirectly influence the community since community members outside the boundaries of the firm are not bound by contractual relationships. As such, firms use their employees as a means of injecting their influence into a project, providing firms with a mechanism of indirect control. [How do firms influence open source software communities? A framework and empirical analysis of different governance modes](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1471772715000111?token=D094A183B8CCBFBF8CA85E63665C958758C014ED78A996947FC05BA5139B99E9A6FB6AA44DABC5828E6F927ED8438E45&originRegion=us-east-1&originCreation=20220613145756)
 
Longitudinal: If the community is initiated by members of the firm,at initiation the power is concentrated in the firm--- the only members of the community are its employees. As newcomers join the community, the power-sharing chocies of the firm decide the degree to which power is shared with external members. It is possible that people outside the firm are permanently relegated to the periphery.

## Do firms engage in open-source for innovation?

## Does our digital infrastructure really rely on Open Source Software?

One interviewee pointed out that large companies like Google/FB don't actually just use open source packages that easily. Can we quantify exactly how much open source software gets used?

## Are programs like GSoC a net negative to organizations that `shepherd' contributions for people that never return?

## Measuring software modularity and understanding how firms retain control
Using something like [fractal figures](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249607047_Analysing_Software_Repositories_to_Understand_Software_Evolution) to understand where firms retain control?


## Critique of liberalism from within liberalism
Intellectual property rights and free speech are both strains of liberalism but the open source movement rejects IP rights while embracing free speech. Read [Coding Freedoms](https://gabriellacoleman.org/Coleman-Coding-Freedom.pdf)
